# Pomodoro App

Demo: https://vercel.com/akaahl/pomodoro-app

This is a pomodoro app that I made based on the design from FrontEndMentor (premium version). The UI design is slightly off than what the FEM challenge requires, this is because I don't have a premium account there, hence I have to make do with what I see.

It is fully functional, but I expect to refactor and update the JS code in the future, as I want to modify some features. I am unable to do it at the moment as I've just started learning HTML, CSS and JS. Once I progress further on my learning journey, I will be very sure to do it.
